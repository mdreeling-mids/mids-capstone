    "# Deploy a Keras or Tensorflow model trained anywhere using Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker makes it easier for any developer or data scientist to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models. While it’s designed to alleviate the undifferentiated heavy lifting from the full life cycle of ML models, Amazon SageMaker’s capabilities can also be used independently of one another; that is, models trained in Amazon SageMaker can be optimized and deployed outside of Amazon SageMaker including edge (mobile or IoT devices). Conversely, Amazon SageMaker can deploy and host pre-trained models such as model zoos or models trained locally by your team. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll demonstrate how to deploy a trained Keras (Tensorflow backend) model using Amazon SageMaker, taking advantage of Amazon SageMaker deployment features, such as selecting the type and number of instances, model compilation to improve inference latency, and autoscaling."

    "In this blog post, we demonstrated converting a Keras model to TensorFlow SavedModel format, deploying a trained model to a SageMaker Endpoint, and compiling the same trained model using SageMaker Neo to get better performance. Using Amazon SageMaker, you can take a trained model and in a few lines of code have a scalable, managed inference deployment. This gives you the flexibility to use your existing model training workflows, while easily deploying trained models to production with all the benefits and optimizations offered by a managed platform."
